--Spark--

Spark is an indie RPG with roguelike dungeons. 
Currently being built by one lazy and overworked high school student with a few friends providing ideas (behind schedule) and moral support (but not much).


Spark takes influences from games like Brogue, Pixel Dungeon (on Android), Final Fantasy, and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.
Programmed in Python using the Pygame module.
